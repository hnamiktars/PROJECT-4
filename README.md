# Korean Content Moderation Dataset

## Project Summary

This project focuses on annotating Korean text data for content moderation. The goal is to classify user-generated content based on safety and policy compliance, which is essential for training AI systems to detect harmful or inappropriate content.

The dataset was manually annotated using Label Studio and exported to structured Excel format.

This project simulates real-world moderation tasks used in AI training, social media filtering, and platform safety systems.
